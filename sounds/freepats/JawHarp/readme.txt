Jaw Harp
--------

Version 2020-06-06

The jaw harp (also known as Jew's harp) is an ancient instrument. It produces
one pitch with many different variations made by the performer.

This sound bank is made by roberto@zenvoid.org with samples of a jaw harp,
sent by Eugene Vlaskin to the FreePats project on February 2018:

  I recorded this sample pack in autumn of 2017 in the North West of Sakhalin
  (in Nekrasovka) with the aid of Michail Chayka (a Nivkh musician who played
  jaw harp) and his mother N.K. Chayka. We used school sound equipment for
  this recording, so the quality is not very good but after processing in
  "Audacity" it seems to me good enough.
